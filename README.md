# The Platform platform

## Quick Start
```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/yannhowe/platformplatform
cd platformplatform
./platformplatform.sh up
```
There are a bunch of things in beta. This means you can docker-compose up them from the folder alone and only when platformplatform isn't running. They have not been secured or configured for backups and restore.
