# The Platform platform

## Quick Start
```
git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/yannhowe/platformplatform
cd platformplatform
# Generate passwords
. ./platformplatform.sh pwgen
./platformplatform.sh up
```
There are a bunch of things in beta. This means you can docker-compose up them from the folder alone and only when platformplatform isn't running. They have not been secured or configured for backups and restore.

## Trendy GitOps
`./gitops.sh` makes deployment check every 60 seconds for new commits in branch.
